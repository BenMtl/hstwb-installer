# HstWB Installer

## Description

HstWB Installer is a set of powershell scripts, image templates, configuration files, 
AmigaDOS scripts and binaries used to easily build Amiga HDF or directory images with 
automated installation of Workbench, Kickstarts roms and packages with additional content.

Setting up a blank Amiga HDF image with e.g. PFS3, Workbench, Kickstarts roms, WHDLoad games and demos 
installed properly can be a cumbersome task unless you spend a lot of time figuring out how this is done step by step.

This is where HstWB Installer come to aid and can help to automate such installations using WinUAE and should 
be possible for almost anyone to do with very little knowledge about Amiga.

The packages included are BetterWB, HstWB, EAB WHDLoad games and demos menus for both AGA and OCS.
Menu packages has screenshots and details for EAB games and demos WHDLoad packs configured for
Arcade Game Selector 2 and iGame.
These packages can be added to an image configuration and will be installed during HstWB Installer installation process.

In general HstWB Installer is build as a minimalistic as possible using BetterWB and HstWB to
support A500 as a minimum. HstWB is mainly targeted A500, A600, A1200.
The minimalistic approach allows users to customize it further with their own preferences like 
installing eg. MagicWB or Scalos.
 
Since Amiga Workbench and Kickstart roms are licensed property these files can't be included 
as they need to be acquired legally by buying Cloanto Amiga Forever or using grabkick from aminet 
to dump roms from real Amiga's.

*HstWB is short for my name and Workbench (very original, I know).* 

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for running and using HstWB Installer are:

* Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10.
* Cloanto Amiga Forever installed or dumps of own Workbench adf files and Kickstart rom files located in a directory.
* WinUAE installed.

## Installation

Installation is quite easy and can be done one the following ways: 

* Download msi installer from releases https://github.com/henrikstengaard/hstwb-installer/releases.
* Clone git repository.
* Click 'Download ZIP' and extract files.

Note: Cloning git repository or 'Download ZIP' doesn't include packages and must be downloaded separately and copied to packages directory.

## User interface

The user interface for HstWB Installer is a console presented via powershell script.
It can be started from:

- Start menu.
- Console either using powershell or run cmd files.

## Settings and data files

HstWB Installer uses the following settings files by default stored in users appdata directory "c:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\HstWB Installer\":

- Settings.ini: Configuration of image.
- Assigns.ini: Configuration of assigns used for install and build self install modes.

To identify Workbench adf and Kickstart rom files, HstWB Installer uses following csv data files:

- Workbench-adf-hashes.csv: Csv file with MD5 hashes to identify Workbench 3.1 adf files.
- Kickstart-rom-hashes.csv: Csv file with MD5 hashes to identify Kickstart rom files.

Name column defines display name.

Set column defines a collection of Workbench files the file is related to. This is used in settings.ini, where WorkbenchAdfSet parameter defines the set of Workbench adf files HstWB Installer will identify and use from directory in WorkbenchAdfPath parameter.

Md5Hash column defines MD5 hash of the Workbench adf file to match. It's recommended to use MD5 hashes as they will give exact matches.

DiskName column defines adf disk name to match. If MD5 hash is not defined, then disk name is used identify the adf file. 
Using disk name support various version of Workbench 3.1 disks from Commodore and Escom.
The disk name method can also identify wrong adf files is they have same name, but that will not be an issue if directory defined in WorkbenchAdfPath parameter only contains Workbenck 3.1 adf files.

Filename column defines the filename the Workbench adf file will be renamed to. HstWB Installer will check if these filename exists and use them when running in install mode.

Name column defines display name.

Set column defines a collection of Kickstart rom files the file is related to. This is used in settings.ini, where KickstartRomSet parameter defines the set of Kickstart rom files HstWB Installer will identify and use from directory in KickstartRomPath parameter.

Md5Hash column defines MD5 hash of the Kickstart rom file to match.

Encrypted column defined if Kickstart rom file is encrypted or not. If encrypted Kickstart rom files are installed, then HstWB Installer will also copy required rom.key file.

Filename column defines the filename the Kickstart rom file will be renamed to. HstWB Installer will check if these filename exists and use them when running in install mode.

## Image templates

Following image templates included to build new images:

1. 4GB: HDF RDB, DH0 (100MB/PFS3), DH1 (3500MB/PFS3)
2. 4GB: HDF RDB, DH0 (300MB/PFS3), DH1 (3300MB/PFS3)
3. 8GB: HDF RDB, DH0 (100MB/PFS3), DH1 (7200MB/PFS3)
4. 8GB: HDF RDB, DH0 (300MB/PFS3), DH1 (7000MB/PFS3)
5. 16GB: HDF RDB, DH0 (300MB/PFS3), DH1 (13100MB/PFS3)
6. UAE4ARM: DH0 (100MB/FFS/HDF), DH1 (DIR)
7. UAE4ARM: DH0 (300MB/FFS/HDF), DH1 (DIR)

4GB, 8GB and 16GB images are RDB HDF's using PFS3 AIO filesystem by Toni Wilen and are formatted with pfsformat filename size of 107 characters. Partitions are created with HDToolbox and configured with MaxTransfer value 0x1fe00. HDF files for these images are created so they are ~100MB smaller than various CF/SD cards, so they can be written to CF/SD card using eg. Win32DiskImager for use in real Amiga's.

UAE4ARM images doesn't use RDB as UAE4Arm doesn't support it and uses a directory mounted as DH1, so it can contain more than 1-2GB of games and demos. 
The limit is then bound to the size of SD card. Using Samba/Windows share eg. "\\retropie\roms\amiga\hstwb\dh1" gives direct access to DH1 partition making it easy to manage content.

---

An image template for HstWB Installer is a zip file containing set of HDF and configuration files, which are used to build a new image.
Image templates are located in "images" directory.

Each image template zip file contains the following files:

1. image.ini (Required): Ini file with image name.
2. harddrives.uae (Required): WinUAE configuration of harddrives for image with [$ImageDir] and [$ImageDirEscaped] placeholders replaced with directory containing image files, when HstWB Installer is launched.
3. disk.hdf (Optional): One or more HDF files ready for use and configured in harddrives.uae.

Image.ini example:
###
    [Image]
    Name=4GB: HDF RDB, DH0 (100MB/PFS3), DH1 (3500MB/PFS3)

Harddrives.uae example:
###
    hardfile2=rw,DH0:[$ImageDir]\4gb.hdf,0,0,0,512,0,,uae
    uaehf0=hdf,rw,DH0:"[$ImageDirEscaped]\\4gb.hdf",0,0,0,512,0,,uae

A new image can be created using the setup script by selecting create a new image directory from image template. 
It will read harddrives.uae file from the image zip file, extract HDF's and create directories defined in "uaehf" lines.

When HstWB Installer is launched, it reads harddrives.uae file from the image directory and merges it into it's WinUAE configuration. 
Placeholders [$ImageDir] and [$ImageDirEscaped] are replaced with the ImageDir configured in HstWB Installer settings.
As an example, the placeholders will be replaced by the following, if ImageDir is configured to "C:\Temp\HstWB-4GB":
###
    [$ImageDir] -> C:\Temp\HstWB-4GB
    [$ImageDirEscaped] -> C:\\Temp\\HstWB-4GB

The escaped placeholder is needed for quoted paths like:
###
    uaehf0=hdf,rw,DH0:"[$ImageDirEscaped]\\4gb.hdf",0,0,0,512,0,,uae

Own image templates can be created by following the examples above or use files from one of the existing image templates to get started. Configuration of harddrives.uae can directly be copied from a saved WinUAE configuration, just replace directory paths with [$ImageDir] and [$ImageDirEscaped] placeholders. 

## Packages

Following packages are included with HstWB Installer msi installation:

* BetterWB: An enhancement built for Workbench 3.1 built by Gulliver for low end Amigas restricted to 68000 processors.
* HstWB: An extension of BetterWB with some icons from ClassicWB and buildin support for ACA, Furia and Blizzard accelerator cards with boot selectors and easy configuration.

An package for HstWB Installer is a zip file containing configuration files, AmigaDOS scripts and resources, which are used to install a package.
Packages are located in "packages" directory.

Each package zip file contains the following files:

- package.ini (Required): Ini file with package details and default assigns.
- install (Required): AmigaDOS script to perform installation of the package.
- other files (Optional): Resource files, which are installed or used during installation.

Before a package installation begins, a set of assigns are added:

- PACKAGEDIR: Path to directory containing the package.
- Assigns for package configured in assigns.ini.

Package.ini example:
###
    [Package]
    Name=EAB WHDLoad Games AGA Menu
    Version=2.6.2
    Dependencies=HstWB
    Assigns=WHDLOADDIR
    [DefaultAssigns]
    WHDLOADDIR=DH1:

Name and version are required parameters.

Dependencies parameter has a comma separated value defining dependencies to other packages. 
If a package doesn't have any dependencies, the dependencies parameter value can be empty or removed.

Assigns parameter has a comma separated value defining required assigns for installing the package. 
These assigns are set before the package is installed and removed when the package is installed.

The default assigns section defines default assign values for the requires assigns. 
These are added to assigns.ini when adding a package and they can be changed later by editing assigns.ini file for customizing installation.

## Installer modes

HstWB Installer supports following installer modes:

- Install: Installs Workbench, Kickstart roms and packages in configured image.
- Build Self Install: Installs scripts, tools and packages in configured image to self install Workbench, Kickstart roms and packages.
- Test: Test configured image.

### Preparing installer run

Before HstWB Installer runs it prepares the files it needs in a temp directory.
For any installer mode HstWB Installer uses WinUAE configuration file "hstwb-installer.uae" in "winuae" directory.
It contains following placeholders used to configure Kickstart rom, DF0: floppy and harddrives:

- [$KICKSTARTROMFILE]: Replaced with path to A1200 Kickstart 3.1 rom file identified in configured kickstart path.
- [$WORKBENCHADFFILE]: Replaced with path to Workbench 3.1 Workbench disk file identified in configured workbench path. This is only used for "Install" and "Build Self Install" installer modes.
- [$HARDDRIVES]: Replaced with harddrives.uae from image directory. For "Install" and "Build Self Install" installer modes directories INSTALL: and PACKAGES: are added containing install scripts, tools and package files to install.  

[$KICKSTARTROMFILE] placeholder example before and after being replaced:
###
    kickstart_rom_file=[$KICKSTARTROMFILE]
    ...
    kickstart_rom_file=c:\Users\Public\Documents\Amiga Files\Shared\rom\amiga-os-310-a1200.rom

[$WORKBENCHADFFILE] placeholder example before and after being replaced:
###
    floppy0=[$WORKBENCHADFFILE]
    ...
    floppy0=c:\Users\Public\Documents\Amiga Files\Shared\adf\amiga-os-310-workbench.adf

[$HARDDRIVES] placeholder example before and after being replaced:
###
    [$HARDDRIVES]
    ...
    hardfile2=rw,DH0:C:\Temp\4GB\4gb.hdf,0,0,0,512,-128,,uae
    uaehf0=hdf,rw,DH0:"C:\\Temp\\4GB\\4gb.hdf",0,0,0,512,-128,,uae
    filesystem2=rw,INSTALL:Install:C:\Users\hst\AppData\Local\Temp\HstWB-Installer_vbb21ubf.ayx\install,6
    uaehf1=dir,rw,INSTALL:Install:C:\Users\hst\AppData\Local\Temp\HstWB-Installer_vbb21ubf.ayx\install,6
    filesystem2=rw,PACKAGES:Packages:C:\Users\hst\AppData\Local\Temp\HstWB-Installer_vbb21ubf.ayx\packages,-128
    uaehf2=dir,rw,PACKAGES:Packages:C:\Users\hst\AppData\Local\Temp\HstWB-Installer_vbb21ubf.ayx\packages,-128

The temp directory will contain WinUAE configuration, startup sequence scripts, tools and extracted packages to install depending on the configuration. 
When HstWB Installer is done the temp directory is deleted.

For "Install" and "Build Self Install" installer modes following additional files are prepared in the temp directory:
- Identifies and copies Kickstart roms files from Kickstart path to temp install directory.  
- Identifies and copies Workbench 3.1 adf files from Workbench path to temp install directory.  
- Extracts packages to temp packages directory.

### Install mode

Running HstWB Installer in install mode does the following in WinUAE:

- Boots from temp install directory added as INSTALL: harddrive.
- Loads commands resident from DF0: required for installation process.
- Installs Workbench 3.1 to SYSTEMDIR: from adf files in INSTALL:, if configured to install Workbench.
- Installs Kickstart roms to SYSTEMDIR:Devs/Kickstarts from rom files in INSTALL:, if configured to install Kickstart.
- Installs packages from temp packages directory added as PACKAGES: harddrive. For each package, required assigns is set before installing a package and removed when package is installed.

When HstWB Installer is done, the image is ready to run in an emulator or on a real Amiga.

### Build self install mode

Running HstWB Installer in build self install mode does the following:

- Boots from temp install directory added as INSTALL: harddrive.
- Loads commands resident from DF0: required for installation process.
- Copy self install scripts and tools to SYSTEMDIR:.
- Copy system files to HSTWBINSTALLER: from temp install directory added as INSTALL: harddrive.
- Copy package files to HSTWBINSTALLER:Packages from temp packages directory added as PACKAGES: harddrive.

When HstWB Installer is done, the image is ready for self install in an emulator or on a real Amiga.

As self install process requires Workbench 3.1 disk, it will detect which floppy drive DF0:, DF1:, DF2: or DF3: contains Workbench 3.1 Workbench disk.
The detect floppy drive will later be used for installing Workbench from floppies, if needed.

Running a self install image in an emulator can automate installation of Workbench 3.1 and Kickstart roms.
This is done during self install process, which detects if following harddrives are present:

- WORKBENCHDIR: Directory added in emulator with Workbench 3.1 adf files.
- KICKSTARTDIR: Directory added in emulator with Kickstart rom files.

Workbench 3.1 adf files will be identify and used to install Workbench, if WORKBENCHDIR: is present.
If WORKBENCHDIR: is not present or if Workbench 3.1 adf installation fails, the self install process will fallback to install Workbench from floppys.

Kickstart roms will be identified and installed to SYSTEMDIR:Devs/Kickstarts, if KICKSTARTDIR: is present.

Then packages are installed, if any are installed in the self install image.

When the self install process is done, the image is ready to run in an emulator or on a real Amiga.

### Test mode

Running HstWB Installer in test mode does the following:

- Boots image for testing configured image directory.

## Configuration

* Workbench: Workbench identified by MD5 hash from defined workbench adf directory. Files from adf's are extracted using unadf and copied to DH0:.
* Kickstart: Kickstart roms identified by MD5 hash from defined kickstart rom directory. Files are copied to DH0:Devs/Kickstarts, required for WHDLoad.

## Usage

**Menu using setup script**

First run HstWB Installer Setup script to configure settings. Default settings are used, if settings file "hstwb-installer-settings.ini" doesn't exist. Each time a setting is changed the settings file is updated or auto saved. When choosing Workbench adf or Kickstart rom set, files in configured directories are examined to find valid Workbench adf and Kickstart rom files required for installation process. Select the set that has all files detected. 

For users with Cloanto Amiga Forever installed, following steps will create a new 8gb image and install Workbench, Kickstart roms:

1. Double-click 'hstwb-installer-setup.cmd' in Windows Explorer or start 'hstwb-installer-setup.ps1' from powershell to run setup script.
2. Type 1 and enter to enter select image menu.
3. Type 2 and enter to enter new image menu.
4. Type 1 and enter to select 8gb image.
5. Type "test.hdf" and press enter.
6. Type 3 and enter to go back to main menu.
7. Type 6 and enter run installer, wait for WinUAE to complete installation process.
8. Press enter to continue.
9. Type 8 and enter to exit.

**Manual using run script**

The settings file "hstwb-installer-settings.ini" can also be created manually with the following content:
