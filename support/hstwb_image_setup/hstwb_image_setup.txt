HstWB Image Setup Readme
------------------------

HstWB Image Setup is a set of scripts to automatically prepare files for self
install and installs UAE and FS-UAE config files.

The scripts are written in both Powershell and Python for cross platform support
of Windows, macOS and Linux and it comes with extra files so they can easily be
run directly from Windows Explorer, macOS Finder and Ubuntu Files.

Self install directories "workbench", "kickstart", "os39" and "userpackages"
are created, if HstWB Image Setup detects UAE and FS-UAE config files has
harddrives configured for self install. Files for self install files are
prepared by detecting and installing Workbench 3.1 adf and Kickstart rom
files in "workbench", "kickstart" directories from Cloanto Amiga Forever,
if it's installed or cd/dvd-rom iso is mounted.

Files for Amiga OS 3.9 and user packages installation must be prepared manually
by manually copying files to self install directories "os39" and "userpackages".
If HstWB Image Setup is unable to detect Cloanto Amiga Forever, then self
install directories "workbench" and "kickstart" must also be prepared manually
by copying files.

Self install directories must contain following:
- "workbench": Directory with Workbench 3.1 adf files.
- "kickstart": Directory with Kickstart rom files.
- "os39": Directory with Amiga OS 3.9 iso and Boing Bag 1 & 2 files.
- "userpackages": Directory with user packages.

Each self install directory is validated to indicate, if required files 
for installation of Workbench 3.1, Kickstart roms, Amiga OS 3.9 and
user packages are present.

UAE and FS-UAE config files are prepared by patching harddrive paths to same
path as config files and install UAE and FS-UAE config files in WinUAE and
FS-UAE default configuration directories.

Kickstart rom file in UAE and FS-UAE config files are patched to use Amiga 1200
Kickstart 3.1 rom, if it exists in "kickstart" directory.

Cd image file in UAE and FS-UAE config files are patched to use Amiga OS3.9 iso,
if it exists in "os39" directory.

For FS-UAE config files, Workbench 3.1 .adf files in "workbench" directory are
added as swappable floppies.
