Amibian HstWB Installer is a preconfigured setup of Amibian with
ready-made harddrives and configs for Amiberry and Chips UAE4ARM
emulators.

It's created to make installation of your Amiga setup as simple 
as possible with users providing their own Workbench 3.1 adf files,
Kickstart rom files and Amiga OS 3.9 files.


Preparation
-----------

1. Write amibian_hstwb-installer.img to sd-card with Win32 Disk
   Imager, ApplePi Baker, dd or similar imaging tool.
2. FAT32 format a usb stick and extract hstwb_installer_install.zip
   to root of the usb stick.
3. Copy install files to usb stick:
   1. Copy required Kickstart rom files to "kickstart" directory.
      HstWB Installer supports Cloanto Amiga Forever 2016 & 7 and 
      original dumps of Kickstart rom files. For Cloanto Amiga 
      Forever copy Kickstart rom files from Cloanto Amiga Forever 
      data directory e.g.
      "c:\users\public\documents\amiga files\shared\rom".
   2. Copy required Workbench 3.1 adf files to "workbench" directory.
      HstWB Installer supports Cloanto Amiga Forever 2016 & 7 and
      original dumps of Workbench 3.1 adf files. For Cloanto Amiga
      Forever copy Workbench adf files from Cloanto Amiga Forever
      data directory e.g. 
      "c:\users\public\documents\amiga files\shared\adf".
   3. Copy optional Amiga OS 3.9 iso file, Boing Bag 1 & 2 lha
      files to "os39" directory. This is only required for Amiga
      OS 3.9 and ClassicWB 3.9 installation and will automatically
      install Amiga OS 3.9 over Workbench 3.1. HstWB Installer 
      requires Amiga OS 3.9 iso is named "AmigaOS3.9.iso", Boing 
      Bag 1 is named "BoingBag39-1.lha" and Boing Bag 2 is named 
      "BoingBag39-2.lha" (it's not case sensitive).
   4. Copy optional EAB WHDLoad Packs v3.0 downloaded and extracted
      from EAB File Server to "userpackages" directory. EAB WHDLoad
      Packs v3.0 directories must be copied to matching directories
      in "userpackages" directory, e.g. copy "Games_WHDLoad" to 
      "userpackages\Games_WHDLoad" directory.
