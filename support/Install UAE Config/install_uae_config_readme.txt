Install UAE Config Readme
-------------------------

Install UAE Config is a set of scripts to install WinUAE and FS-UAE config files
for HstWB images by patching directories to where the directory the image is located
and install WinUAE and FS-UAE config files in WinUAE and FS-UAE's default 
installation directory. This can also be done manually in WinUAE and FS-UAE updating
configuration with changing hard drives and Kickstart rom. The scripts are written in
both Powershell and Python for cross platform Windows, Mac OS X and Linux support and 
comes with extra files so they can easily be run directly from Windows Explorer, 
Mac OS X Finder and Ubuntu Files.

Install UAE Config will patch and install WinUAE and FS-UAE config files. Patching
updates hard drive directories to current directory, changes Kickstart rom file and
adds adf files as swappable floppies for FS-UAE only. Install copies patched
WinUAE and FS-UAE config files to default configuration directory for WinUAE and
FS-UAE. For Windows install copies Workbench 3.1 adf files and Kickstart rom files
from Cloanto Amiga Forever, if it's installed. 

When hard drive directories are patched to use current directory, Install UAE Config
will create following sub-directories, if they exist in WinUAE or FS-UAE config files:
- Workbench: Directory with Workbench adf files.
- Kickstart: Directory with Kickstart rom files.
- OS39: Directory with Amiga OS 3.9 iso and boing bag 1 & 2 files.
- UserPackages: Directory with user packages.

Kickstart rom file is patched to use Amiga 1200 Kickstart 3.1 rom, if it exists in
Kickstart directory.

For FS-UAE config file, .adf files in Workbench directory are added as swappable
floppies.
