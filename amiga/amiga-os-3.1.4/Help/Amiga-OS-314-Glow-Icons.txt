Amiga OS 3.1.4 Glow Icons
-------------------------

Amiga OS 3.1.4 comes with a colorful and professionally
designed icon set called Glow Icons.

Glow Icons works best with a plain Amiga OS 3.1.4
installation without any Workbench enhancement packages
like ClassicWB, BestWB, BetterWB or HstWB as they will
overwrite icons with their own icon set.

Select "Yes" to install Glow Icons, if installing a
plain Amiga OS 3.1.4 without any Workbench enhancement
packages. Note Glow Icons might be overwritten, if
installing any packages.

Select "No" to install Glow Icons, if installing
Workbench enhancement packages like ClassicWB, BestWB,
BetterWB or HstWB.

Regardless of choice, Glow Icons are copied to a
"Icons" drawer and can always be manually installed
later.


Screenmode
----------

Glow Icons looks best with interlaced screenmode, so
it's recommended to update screenmode to interlaced.

Select "Yes" to update screenmode for optimal interlaced
screenmode with Glow Icons. Note screenmode might be
overwritten, if installing any packages.

Select "No" to update screenmode for keeping non
interlaced screenmode.
