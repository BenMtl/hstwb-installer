User packages help
------------------

Detected user packages shows valid user packages detected
in USERPACKAGESDIR: device. This only shows detected user
packages before starting self install. User packages can
be selected and installed later during self install.

Select "Show detect user packages log" to examine details
about detected user packages.

If one or more user packages are not detected, user
packages can be changed now and detect user packages can
be restarted by selecting "Restart detect user package".

If detected user packages are as expected, then select
"Continue with [x] user package(s)" to continue self
install.
