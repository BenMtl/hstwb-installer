User packages available help
----------------------------

User packages available shows valid user packages detected
in USERPACKAGESDIR: device. A valid user package must have
a "_installdir" file indicating default drawer to install
the user package to. User packages available only shows
user packages available before starting self install. User
packages can be selected and installed later during self
install.

Select "Show detect user packages log" to examine details
about detected user packages.

If one or more user packages are not detected, user
packages can be changed and detect user packages can
be restarted by selecting "Restart detect user package".

If detected user packages are as expected, then select
"Continue with [x] user package(s) available" to continue
self install.
