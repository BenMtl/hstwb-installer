Packages available help
-----------------------

Packages available shows packages that can be installed,
when Amiga OS and Kickstart installation is complete. These
packages have copied to this the self install image, when
the self install image was build.

Packages available only shows packages available before
starting self install. Packages can be selected and
installed later during self install.

Select "Continue with [x] package(s) available" to
continue self install.
