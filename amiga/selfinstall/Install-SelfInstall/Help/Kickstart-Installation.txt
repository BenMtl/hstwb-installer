Kickstart installation help
---------------------------

Kickstart installation shows valid kickstart installations
detected in KICKSTARTDIR: device, which can be installed.
HstWB Installer supports both Cloanto Amiga Forever
kickstart rom files and dumps of original kickstart rom
files.

Kickstart installations are mostly used for running demos
and games from harddrive using WHDLoad. It's recommended
to have at least Kickstart 1.3 (34.5) A500 rom installed
to run most demos and games. Some packages also install
accelerator card tools like BlitzKick or ACATune, which
can utilize maprom functionality to map kickstart rom
files as if the kickstart rom is installed in the Amiga.

The detection process examines file md5 checksums to
identify valid kickstart installations. Each detected
Kickstart installation is indicated by "Install". Kickstart
installations that wasn't detected are indicated with "N/A"
for not available.

Installing one or more Cloanto Amiga Forever requires
rom key is also installed.

When correct Kickstart installations are selected, then
select "Continue with Kickstart..." to continue self
install.
