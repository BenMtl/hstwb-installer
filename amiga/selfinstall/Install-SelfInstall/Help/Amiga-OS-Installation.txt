Amiga OS Installation Help
--------------------------

Amiga OS Installation shows valid Amiga OS installations
detected, which can be installed. HstWB Installer
supports Amiga OS 3.9, 3.1.4 and 3.1. Each detected
Amiga OS installation is indicated by "Install" or "Skip"
and the highest version of Amiga OS detected is selected
by default. The Amiga OS installations that wasn't
detected are indicated with "N/A" for not available.

It's only possible to select one Amiga OS installation
to install, so selecting another Amiga OS installation
than currently selected will automatically deselect the
previous selected Amiga OS Installation changing it from
"Install" to "Skip".

When correct Amiga OS is selected, then then select
"Continue with Amiga OS ..." to continue self install.
