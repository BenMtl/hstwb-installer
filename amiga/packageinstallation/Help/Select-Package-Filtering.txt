Select package filtering help
-----------------------------

Select package filtering lists different Amiga OS
versions that is supported by the packages. Some 
packages only work with specific versions of Amiga OS,
while others may work for any Amiga OS version.
Installing a package on an unsupported Amiga OS may
cause either Amiga OS or the package to not work
properly.

By default the package installation will auto-detect
the Amiga OS version installed and select it as
package filtering. In case the auto-detected Amiga OS
version failed or selected a wrong Amiga OS version,
please manually select correct Amiga OS version.

Select 'Auto-detect Amiga OS version' to reset package
filtering to default.
